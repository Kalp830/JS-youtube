This JavaScript code snippet is designed to add a task to a list when the user inputs a task and clicks a button (presumably linked to the `Add` function). It also allows the user to remove tasks from the list by clicking a trash icon.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. **Variable Definitions**:
   - `inputs`: This variable stores the DOM element with the ID `"input-box"`. It is used to access the text that the user inputs.
   - `text`: This variable stores the DOM element with the class `"text"`. It is used as a container where new tasks (as list items) will be added.

2. **`Add()` Function**:
   - The `Add` function is triggered (likely by a button) when the user wants to add a task.
   - **Empty Input Check**: 
     - The function first checks if the `inputs.value` (the text entered by the user) is empty (`""`). 
     - If the input is empty, an alert pops up with the message "Please Enter Task".
   - **Adding a Task**:
     - If the input is not empty, the function proceeds to create a new HTML element `<ul>` with `document.createElement("ul")`.
     - The `innerHTML` of the new `<ul>` element is set to the value of the user's input followed by a trash icon represented by `<i class="fa fa-trash"></i>`.
     - This new `<ul>` element is then appended to the `text` container using `text.appendChild(newEle)`.
     - The input field is then cleared (`inputs.value=""`) to prepare for a new task entry.
   - **Remove Functionality**:
     - An event listener is added to the trash icon within the new `<ul>` element. This event listener listens for a `click` event and triggers the `remove` function.
     - The `remove` function simply removes the parent `<ul>` element (i.e., the task) from the DOM using `newEle.remove()`.

### Summary
- The code enables users to add tasks to a list and remove them by clicking a trash icon next to each task.
- If the user attempts to add a task without entering any text, an alert prompts them to enter a task.
